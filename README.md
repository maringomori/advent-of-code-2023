# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language.

```
         * 
        /|\                  
       /*|O\
      /*/|\*\
     /X/O|*\X\
    /*/X/|\X\*\
   /O/*/X|*\O\X\             
  /*/O/X/|\X\O\*\
 /X/O/*/X|O\X\*\O\
/O/X/*/O/|\X\*\O\X\
        |X|      
        |X|  
```

Having some fun with the challenges. The code here is not optimized or refined - the primary goal is to make it work. At the end of each solution file, I've noted the time of completion for each part. I may revisit and refine them at a later point.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). It consists of a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and can be solved in any order. Participation is free and the puzzles become available at midnight EST each day in December.

## My Approach

In tackling these puzzles, I focused on creating functional solutions rather than optimizing for efficiency or elegance. This approach reflects my aim to enjoy the problem-solving process and learn through experimentation.

## Progress

- [x] Day 1: Trebuchet?! (Time of completion: 31:17)


## Structure of this Repo

Each day's puzzle solution is in a separate folder named `dayXX` where `XX` is the day of the month. For example, `day01`, `day02`, etc.

Each folder contains:
- The puzzle description in a `README.md` file.
- Source code files.
- Any input data provided by the puzzle.
- Additional resources or notes, if any.

## Usage

Instructions on how to run the solutions:

```bash
# Example of how to run a solution
python day01/part1.py
python day01/part2.py
```
